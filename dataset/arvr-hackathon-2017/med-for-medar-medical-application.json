Hololens API integration with some interactions we want\n2. Precision of gestures\n3. Imaging\n4. Performance\n## Accomplishments that we're proud of\n5. we actually pull that off\n6. results are good enough for two days work\n## What we learned\n7. More possible ways to develop for Hololens AR application\n8. Imaging\n9. Solve performance issue\n## What's next for Med for Med: AR Medical Application\n10. add remote session\n11. Dynamical loading from external drive\n## Credits\nAll the medical images/models are from UMass Medical\nHololens API\nSome control codes along with medical assets\n\n\n"
