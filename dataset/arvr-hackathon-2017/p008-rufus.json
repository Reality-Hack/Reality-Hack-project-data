I made sure that the visual content (3D models, 2D art) and audio content (sound/music) was integrated properly into the virtual world (Unity). Changing of lightings, shaders, skyboxes, activation/deactivation of GameObjects/Lights/Sound\n Sources was programmed/managed by me. I also made sure that the application ran smoothly on a HTC Vive. In fact, the application runs at 100 FPS. In order to manage the enormous amount of content generated by the film director, sound expert, graphics designer and tiltbrush artist, I wrote a framework from scratch to handle/manage this data.",
