I have spent 13 years working as an educator and observing firsthand the desperate need for a change. As a society we are failing our students by refusing to update our educational practices. We need to stop trying to change the way they learn and start changing the way we teach. </p>\n<p>As a special education teacher, I would watch my students fight and struggle to find a way to gain access to the curriculum equal to their general education peers. A new app would come out that \u201cimproved scores by so many percentage points\u201d but it required the user to listen to prompts. My students who are deaf could not play that. Another new app would debut, but that one would require students to manipulate small numbers on the screen or type numbers in under a certain time. That eliminated my students with underdeveloped fine motor skills. The next \u201cacademic game\u201d hits the market, and this one finally makes learning fun. In order to do that however, you have to visually sift through a massive array of information whilst multiple rounds of distracting noises are pummeling you. There goes the access for my students with Autism Spectrum Disorder.</p>\n<p>During the course of development, specific and intentional decisions were made so that this game will be played by students of all ability levels. Utilizing the latest technology including eye tracking, this game is engaging for all students. When we harness the power of VR we are only limited by our imaginations, and students who were left out of participating in the past due to wheelchairs, lack of fine motor skills, non-verbal communication, finally have an experience designed with them in mind. The best part about making those specific decisions is that it forced us to create new and inventive ways of responding to academic questions, and come to find out, those ways are fun for all kids.</p>\n<h2>What it does:</h2>\n<p>Challenges the player to answer a series of standards based subject specific questions in new and inventive ways. Worksheets are a thing of the past.</p>\n<h3>Brain Drain</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/TeTAb5nN77c\" rel=\"nofollow\">Video Here</a></p>\n<p>During dark and troubling times, two doctors are hard at work in their wicked laboratory.  It is in this dark and evil place that Dr. Apprentice and Dr. Novice create a potential world changing virus.  They have created the \u201cPhantom Virus\u201d which takes kids from hard working, intelligent students, to \u201cphantoms\u201d who walk around repeating different academic questions until they receive an answer.</p>\n<p>Dr. Apprentice and Dr. Novice finally had their virus, but they did not know how to release its wrath upon the world. Finally they thought of a brilliant plan\u2026they put the virus in unhealthy foods! Sodas, candy, any food that they knew kids liked but that was not good for them got dosed with the Phantom Virus.  Within days the virus started to spread world-wide. They thought they had won; they celebrated because they did not think there was anyone who could stop them!  But\u2026mankind\u2019s last hope rested with a brother and sister duo. Backed by their two beagles, they were ready to save the world!</p>\n<p>Watson and Spiller were playing outside when they started to notice all the adults were gone. All the sudden a turtle, raccoon and dog start talking to them! They explain about the virus and inform Spiller and Watson that they are the world\u2019s only hope! Spiller and Watson knew they had to act fast if they were going to save the world! The animals did not want them to go, but they knew they were the up for the challenge. They loaded them up with plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables, toothbrushes, toothpaste, deodorant, and water to help fight off the Phantom kids if they needed to.\n \u201cYou will have help and protection out there\u201d The animals looked at their pet beagles, Wendi and Jessi as they spoke.  </p>\n<p>Wendi and Jessi barked in agreement, letting them know that they would be there to protect them no matter what!\nThis is where you come in!</p>\n<p>You can play as either Spiller or Watson, and if you have a friend you can team up and play together!\nYou will travel around the world and as you come upon a Phantom, you have three choices.  You can answer their question correctly; throw fruits/vegetables/water/hygiene products at them to buy yourself some time while you think of the correct answer. Lastly, if you cannot think of an answer you can ask Wendi and Jessi for help, but be careful because they only can give you one answer each per level (unless you find some hidden dog treats throughout the level, and build up a few bonus answers).</p>\n<p>If you answer correctly you will cure the Phantom and turn him/her back into a child who is ready to join your army! You will need a giant army with you when you finally make it to the Doctor\u2019s laboratory, where you will fight to take them out once and for all!</p>\n<p>Be prepared, each world offers different subjects you will have to conquer. </p>\n<p>The ultimate challenge of Brain Drain is there is no mouse or keyboard. YOU are the controller! If your character needs to jump, then you need to jump, if your character has to run, put your running shoes on because you will be moving! You will be out of your desk, moving, jumping, running and learning all at the same time! </p>\n<p>As you move around the world, you can collect other prizes to help you along the way. You will find scooters, bicycles, and roller skates to help you move faster. As you make your way from world to world, the questions will get harder, so be ready!  When you have to stop the game, you will return to \u201chome base.\u201d Here your mother will make you a home cooked meal, and you can rest up for the next day\u2019s adventure. While at home, you will log onto your computer and see how many Phantoms you saved, what questions you were asked, and what % you answered correctly. This will allow you to understand what subjects you did well on, and what subjects you need to practice for the next round!\nDo you have the skills and willingness to study hard so that you can save the world from certain doom!? If so, get your mind ready and begin your adventure through Brain Drain! </p>\n<h2>How I built it:</h2>\n<p>Brain Drain is a virtual reality experience, therefore we built the educational game with Unity using the HTC VIVE Toolkit.
