All of the assets and environments were drawn/made during the hackathon (2 days) using Quill (Oculus).  I truly believe the efficiency and simplicity of Quill is unmatched for events like the XR Hackathon and Global Game Jam. I really enjoyed creating the world and characters for our concept also a big thank you to my awesome team!",
