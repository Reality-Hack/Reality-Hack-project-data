How better they are progressing in their work  . I made a neural network model which I trained with the data of my fellow team members and we had one person with ADHD , I took his data as positive data and other four team member data as negative one . Further I gathered data from different teams . For making my model not be biased with negative cases , I programatically made test cases so we are feeding the unbiased data to our model using many parameters as inputs from various eye movements , change in size of pupil , change in tensions of eye skin and many more .",
