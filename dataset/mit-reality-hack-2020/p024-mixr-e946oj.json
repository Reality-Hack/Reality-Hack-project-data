Only through exploration and play do MiXR's underlying systems emerge. MiXR is the ultimate audio-visual synthesizer that maps the unique ways in which individuals move through space to a generative environment.\n\n\nWith MiXR Studios, everyone is an artist.\n\n\n## Design Inspiration\n\n\nWe set out to allow people to experience music in an abstract way rather than using 3D representations of real instrument shapes (like floating disks to look like a drum pad, or a set of rectangular keys for a keyboard).
