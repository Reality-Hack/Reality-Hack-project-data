I contributed to our project's design, development (in Unity/C#), project management, and user experience. I was thankful for a team that was open and honest with communication, respectful, and talented in our individual ways. The success of creating a fully fledged technical prototype is super inspiring, and I can't wait to continue designing and developing edifying VR projects after this amazing hackathon.",
