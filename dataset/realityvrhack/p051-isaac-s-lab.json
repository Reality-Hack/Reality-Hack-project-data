            "about": "I'm new to Unity, but was lucky enough to get on a team with some real experts.  With their guidance, I quickly got up to speed on the basics and was able to apply my background in other applications to our project development.  I worked on sourcing, conversion, and importing some of the models that we used.  I also staged some of the scenes that were then integrated with the overall project.  I was also able to develop some of the scripts used to overlay contextual information (e.g., velocity text).  As a mechanical engineer with a background in instructional design, I helped with storyboarding and the underlying equations of motion we used to govern the VR world.  I brought all kinds of equipment, tools, and tricks that we leveraged to hack together a very cool project.  Lastly, this was an amazing weekend and I hope that my enthusiasm was contagious.  We definitely meshed as a team and worked very well together.  ",

In addition, I developed the graphs needed to plot the position vs. time, velocity vs. time, and acceleration vs. time.",
