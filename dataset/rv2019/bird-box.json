I customize a Photon Unity Network v2(PUN2) template for both BirdBox AR and VR Unity Scenes. My strategy is simply to see if AR and VR can share the same spatial visualization through separate project build while sharing the same PUN2 ID, and it works. So, I find out we can now create multiplayer projects crossing both AR VR platforms, specifically in our projects we utilize Android Phones and Mixed Reality Headset.",
