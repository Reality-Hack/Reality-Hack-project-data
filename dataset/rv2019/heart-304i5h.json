Initiated the idea to integrate webcam of Magic Leap for e.g. detection of vital sign detection (heart rate), extended to identification via face recognition (both via machine learning). Created video, devpost and facilitated communication between team, mentors and organizers. ",

As physician I was able to articulate the unmet need of doctors and frustrations that they share during the course of healthcare delivery. I created icons and designs for the project. I was able to create prototype of UI using sketch and inVision. ",
