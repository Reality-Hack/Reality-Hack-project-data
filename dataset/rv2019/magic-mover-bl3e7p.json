However, AR seems to be promising in particular for home-based rehab because, unlike VR, AR overlaps virtual images onto the real world environments during simulation, thus possibly limiting the discomfort in patients. Recent evolutions of AR, like Hololens and Magic Leap One, by tracking the environmental structure where they are in, allow to literally place virtual objects in specific 3D positions, thus opening interesting perspectives for novel iteractive forms of rehabilitation.  </p>\n<p>We looked for fields where AR based rehab could contribute most, and found that post-stroke treatments could clearly benefit from the engaging interactive technology, which could help motivate and empower the patients to fully recover. In particular, this become important in the later stages of the rehab process or when patients no longer need hospital treatments, since they may want to work on their skills at home to get back to normal mobility and function. </p>\n<p>With Magic Mover, we could help by giving them the resources and motivation.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We decided to build an AR game involving interacting with (i.e. moving and stacking) virtual objects. The user would move/stack them by looking at the object and placing it on a virtual mat (both of them anchored in the real space). Over time, the levels will get harder, requiring the user to move around the real space with increasing the complexity and magnitude of movements.</p>\n<p>The fun looking objects and new technology would better motivate the patient to practice at home, and the app would get the patient up and moving without straining them to move objects that may result too heavy. Each game level would have new objects, allowing the patient to have a diverse experience tailored to their current abilities. They can increase the game difficulty when they feel that they have mastered the level, or repeat the level with the objects in slightly different spots to maintain interest.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We spent a large portion of time designing the different components of the product in a way that would have enough versatility to improve motor, balance, and cognitive skills, but also have a unifying theme throughout. We also made sure that there was possibility for expansion into other fields through our project. Finally, we aimed to make it as fun as possible while working on these skills to keep patients interested and engaged in order to ensure they would actually use at home.</p>\n<p>The project has been developed with Unity 3D and targeted to Microsoft Hololens. We chose appealing assets and programmed them to glow when the user is looking at them, and show a timer. When this timer is full, the virual object is picked up and it is displayed in front of the user. Then the user can move it onto the mat, which would also bring up a timer and at the end of the timer, drop the object where you put it (the timer would allow positioning). We programmed each of these actions in Unity, and used the Unity Spacial Mapping Toolkit to randomly generate objects in the desired section of the room.</p>\n<p>We designed our interface in Adobe Illustrator and XD. Our interface is made with large clickable buttons to avoid too fine of movement for stroke patients. We also gave our game a catchy name and animated our title to communicate the movement and the new technology the patients would get to use.
