The potential of the seeds is illustrated in the diversity of the flowers. Each flower now represents one portion, one possible realization of the sensation. While we suggest the emotions of happiness, melancholy and neutrality, the interpretation is up to the individual. You can linger on one sound, survey them all, or listen for the juxtapositions to match your own mood. In all this we want you to stay grounded, so that you can connect your emotions to your life directly. </p>\n<h2>What it does:</h2>\n<p>We created a garden of sound using plants as instruments.
