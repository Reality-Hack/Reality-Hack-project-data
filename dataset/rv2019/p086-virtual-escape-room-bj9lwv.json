With only 10 minutes to spare, you'll need to use magic, potions, and your wits to explore and navigate through this intricate trap. Will you escape the witch's grotto?</p>\n<h2>What it Does</h2>\n<p>The chest contains a final key that allows the player to escape and win the game. In order to open the chest, the player must create three potions. A magma, ice, and acid potion must all be poured onto the chest to unlock it.</p>\n<p>The escape room puzzle system takes advantage of a modular brewing system in which you can take any object, put it into the cauldron, and then pull a potion out of the cauldron based on the contents you put into it. Each asset has a value for three different attributes, and when mixed together, correspond to different potions. </p>\n<p>With these combinations, a player is able to make a potion from a variety of combinations. For example, a player can make a fire potion by throwing a torch into the cauldron because the torch has the hot, rough, and red characteristics. Alternatively, the player could also make a fire potion using a red mushroom which is smooth and red, combined with a candle which is hot.</p>\n<p>If the player makes the correct potion, the player will be able to pick up a potion that has either red, blue, or green liquid. If the player makes the incorrect potion, the player will receive a potion with black liquid inside.

with connecting to Github, our team was forced to create a new repository which also prevented several of our members from accessing the project. We pivoted to using Unity Collaborate for the majority of the hackathon as it served as a better platform for us to manage multiple iterations of our product. Our Github site shows a screen capture of the multiple commits we made using Unity Collaborate.  </p>\n<h2>What's Next</h2>\n<p>We accomplished our original goal of creating a prototype of a witch-themed VR escape room. There were also several other puzzles that we wanted to implement but were not able to complete in the scope of the hackathon. We originally wanted to add missing potion recipes that needed to be found by using potions created by the player. For example, we planned to add a shrinking and growth potion that would allow the player to walk into a mousehole to find a missing page. In addition, we planned to make a crow in a birdcage prevent the player from reaching a page unless a sleep potion was used. These are all several additions that would add puzzles to the game.</p>\n<p>Our prototype could be expanded into a escape room level-editor platform. Rather than users creating assets from scratch, adding colliders, and developing game mechanics, we can create these components so anyone can more intuitvely build a VR escape room in VR, and test it using their own VR headset.</p>\n</div>",

We originally wanted to add missing potion recipes that needed to be found by using potions created by the player. For example, we planned to add a shrinking and growth potion that would allow the player to walk into a mousehole to find a missing page. In addition, we planned to make a crow in a birdcage prevent the player from reaching a page unless a sleep potion was used. These are all several additions that would add puzzles to the game.\n\n\nOur prototype could be expanded into a escape room level-editor platform. Rather than users creating assets from scratch, adding colliders, and developing game mechanics, we can create these components so anyone can more intuitvely build a VR escape room in VR, and test it using their own VR headset.\n\n\n"
