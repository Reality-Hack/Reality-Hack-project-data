It has been practiced since medieval times, and it is essential to artists, architects, animators, and many others who practice visual art. One member of our team is an artist and aspiring sculptor. She frequently uses 2D tracing device (light table, tracing paper, etc) in making illustrations. She and many of her classmates wished to have a 3D version of tracing device to assist sculpting. Realizing this pain point, we brainstormed together and got excited that modern mixed-reality technology could be the key to the problem!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Now, it's time to move history to the next step. Imagine a light table or tracing paper for sculptures. With mixed reality, you can create a perfect sculpture by tracing a 3D hologram. This HoloLens application projects a 3D model onto your table for you to trace, and guides you through the sculpting process step by step starting from a basic model. You can increase the level of detail progressively. We believe this tool will be very useful in education, art practices, and for anyone creating a personal gift. You can sculpt your favorite characters or anything your passion guides you! Plus, utilizing hand gestures and voice commands, you don't have to touch your computers/book/model references with dirty hands!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our team consists of 3 software students and a 2D artist/aspiring sculptor. In the first 5 hours, we focused mainly on the problem space, brainstormed the project blueprint template that we learned from the PTC workshop, and designed our user journey + UX storyboard. After having fun talking about multiple solutions and doing UX roleplaying, we prioritized and narrowed our list of features! We ranked the features based on 1. Impact, 2. Technical Challenge, 3. Art Vibe, and 4. Innovation. Then, we assigned each other tasks. Our youngest team member took the initiative to learn about 3D modeling. Our designer guided us in the UX journey and designed various components.
