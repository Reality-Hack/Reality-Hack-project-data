The objects would start off invisible and while the light was on it, the object slowly came into the scene and now became dynamic. These objects were then used to snap into place as the missing piece of the puzzle that needed to be solved. Being a asymmetrical experience the mobile player was the only one that could trigger the effect while the VR player could then and only then interact with that object.",
